# Multi-class classification & Classification models

### Lesson Overview

We have seen the power of databases and SQL as a data-gathering technique. We will go now over data pre-processing, data cleaning, feature exploration, and feature engineering and show the impact that every step has on machine learning model performance. We will use logistic regression, this time in the context of multi-class classification.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Conceptualize the data analysis workflow
- Explain logistic regression
- Differentiate binary classification and multi-class classification problems
- Use logistic regression for multi-class classification
- Check the accuracy of the model
